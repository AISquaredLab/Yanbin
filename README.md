4. Read Measure Theory (slow)


## Previouly Doing
1. 随机森林预测股价，参数是股票的基本数据，不ok
2. 完成阅读推荐系统实践

2. Wasserstein GAN https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875
3. Deconstructing Generative Adversarial Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09465

## Previouly Reading
1. Generative Adversarial Nets https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf
2. NIPS 2016 Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160


## Current Problem
1. Go too slow in measure theory
2. When building the stock, cannot generate a balanced GAN
3. Cannot understand https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05488 at all...qwq
